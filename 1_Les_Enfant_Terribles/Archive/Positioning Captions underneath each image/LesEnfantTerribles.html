<p> Liquid was the leader of FOXHOUND's rebellion during the Shadow Moses Incident. At the relatively young age of 33, he was in charge of the Next Generation Special Forces as well.
These were soliders whose combat abilities were enhanced due to being exposed to Big Boss' DNA. Liquid's objective was to cause the world to go into terror again, where countries and 
opposing super powers constantly created bloodshed. In doing so, Liquid believed that this would give rise to solider's so that they could be recognised in glory again as supposed to 
being political tools. </p>
<br>
<p> Towards the end of the Shadow Moses Incident, Liquid engaged his twin-brother , Solid Snake, to a battle between warriors. Liquid shared vehemently that he felt inferior to Snake 
since the day they were born - in that he believed right up to his decease that he was given Big Boss' inferior genes during the time he and Solid were made. Due to this, he felt that
he - and the other 6 clones - were sacrificed to make the ''superior'' clone, Solid Snake. Little did he know two things. One - ultimately 5 clones were sacrificed so Liquid never
had awareness of Solidus' existence. And two - he in fact had the superior genes all along and Solid was the one with the inferior genes. A bit ironic. </p>
