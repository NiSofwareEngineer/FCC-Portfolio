<article id="introduction">



<p> 1972 - a year of many tragic events. The terrorism events causing the massacre of 11 Israelian atheletes and tensions between the UK and IRA government as 22 bombs explode in
Ireland resulting in 130 injured and 9 killed took place in this year.</p>


<p> However, 1972's tragic events are even further diminished by one terrifying, hidden secret of America - Les Enfants Terribles. Using the, theroretical, Super Baby Method and
human's arguably arrogant confidence of knowing every human gene (The Human Genome Project), America wanted to re-create genes which were capable of producing the ultimate soldier.
As a result, creating the perfect army which America can use as it's trump card by in essence, making every card it had in war as powerful as a trump card. How was this done? By 
making use of the legendary soldier's genes - Big Boss himself. Big Boss didn't have a choice in the matter either - he was put against his will in order for this project to actualise.

The result was Les Enfants Terribles - meaning The Terrible Children. Consisting of an octuplut, that is 8, clones, only two were believed to survive. Later, well known to many as 
Liquid and Solid Snake. However, to even Liquid's and Solid's surprise, there were actually <em> three clones </em> who were born from this dark secret.

<p> During 200X - 200X , the president was George Sears. This means that indeed, Mr Sears had a large bearing on the Shadow Moses Incident of 2005. Whilst the threat of a nuclear weapon
- some type of Metal Gear- was clear, the president at the time had a hidden agenda. He worked with the world's best spy - Revolver Ocelot - to retrieve data surrounding the creation
and use of Metal Gear Rex. Why? Well, nothing stops a president from abusing his position and changing society to suit their own agenda, duh.</p>

<p> Solidus was completely unknown to both of his other cloned brothers - Liquid and Solid. The fact he was able to be president and his brothers were unable to recognise any resemblence
to him is worrying considering they are supposed to be master soldiers capable of, you know, basic observation skills.... </p>

<p> Liquid was the leader of FOXHOUND's rebellion during the Shadow Moses Incident. At the relatively young age of 33, he was in charge of the Next Generation Special Forces as well.
These were soliders whose combat abilities were enhanced due to being exposed to Big Boss' DNA. Liquid's objective was to cause the world to go into terror again, where countries and 
opposing super powers constantly created bloodshed. In doing so, Liquid believed that this would give rise to solider's so that they could be recognised in glory again as supposed to 
being political tools. </p>
<br>
<p> Towards the end of the Shadow Moses Incident, Liquid engaged his twin-brother , Solid Snake, to a battle between warriors. Liquid shared vehemently that he felt inferior to Snake 
since the day they were born - in that he believed right up to his decease that he was given Big Boss' inferior genes during the time he and Solid were made. Due to this, he felt that
he - and the other 6 clones - were sacrificed to make the ''superior'' clone, Solid Snake. Little did he know two things. One - ultimately 5 clones were sacrificed so Liquid never
had awareness of Solidus' existence. And two - he in fact had the superior genes all along and Solid was the one with the inferior genes. A bit ironic. </p>

<p> Raised by many people and living with a strong belief of not getting involved with others' lives, Solid Snake was a lone wolf. During his success during a early career at 
FOXHOUND he sucessfully took down Metal Gear, made a friend known as  and even had to killBig Boss himself. He then joined the CIA but left after only 6 months,
deciding to go to Alaska and fend to fifty dogs. You can't blame him for that decision surely... </p>
<br>
<p> Fast forward 6 years later - Solid Snake is ambushed by operatives under the control of Snake's "friend", Colonel Roy Campbell. Campbell ''requests'' Snake to take on a mission
to stop what was believed to be a terrorist plot being led by former members of FOXHOUND. Ultimately, the objective was to assess and stop any nucler threat posed which led to Snake
finding that he had a twin brother - Liquid. Further, he faced Metal Gear Rex, a creation of Dr Hal Emmerrich AKA Otacon. Snake meeting Otacon however was the turning point. This
was when he decided that in truth, life is better alongside others. Indeed, a famous question posed by Otacon to Snake was ''Does love bloom on the battlefield?" Scholars say this
was the question that completely re-arranged Snake's mind and led to him falling in love and living happily ever after.</p>
