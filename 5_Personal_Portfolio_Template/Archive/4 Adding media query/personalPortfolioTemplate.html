<h1> Welcome To My Portfolio </h1>

	<p> Programming has been the start of a new career for me. I got inspiration to start coding due to people
	I know that have entered the field of Software Engineering with success. Enjoying the journey of learning is important as reaching the end goal
	and my passion in learning and applying code is strong thanks to this mindset.

<h2 id = "technicalDoc" class="project-title"> Project 1 : Technical Documentation</h2

	<p>
	This project is a template for a technial documentation. It uses one main section with a <code>main-doc</code> id. Inside this section, it 
	has as many other sections as required. The template I made has five sections inside the <code>main-doc</code> section. This then allows one to 
	input information about a subject.
	</p>
	
	<p> In the example given, I call the subject <code> myApp</code>. I then seperate the headings of the documentation to describe the features of <code> myApp </code>
	and how to use it, the advantages of it's features, it's target audience and it's areas for improvement.

<h2 id= "bookFeedBackForm" class="project-title"> Project 2 : Book Feedback Form </h2>


	<p> This project uses features such as checkboxes , a drop down menu with choices and a text box. It is designed to be a feedback form where the user can select
	their answers from the options provided. Some important details include the fact that the user can choose as many checkboxes but can only choose one of the radio
	buttons provided.
	</p>
	
	<p> As a result, the feedback form can be customised to fit the objective of what information the developer wants to obtain. There is a submit button at the end.
	The submit button will only work if the name and email input fields are filled in correctly. For the email input field, the user must even ensure there is a '@' somewhere
	in the input as all emails require to have a @. This makes the form validated with suitable inputs before it is submitted. 
	</p>

<h2 id="productLandingPage" class="project-title"> Project 3 : Product Landing Page </h2>
	
	
	<p> This project splits the elements into three sections - a nav bar , a opt-in field form and a list of frequently asked questions. The nav bar has internal links
	which when clicked, re-direct the user to a designated part of the web page. For example, clicking on ''opt-in'' will send the user to part of the web page which has input
	fields.
	</p>
	
	<p> Again, like the Book Feedback Form project, all of the inputs are checked for validation before they are sent. The checks include that the name and email fields have 
	been filled in and that the email field as a '@' somewhere.
